<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyimide Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyimide fibers are high-performance materials known for their exceptional thermal stability, chemical resistance, and mechanical strength. In the market, they are produced using two primary methods: wet spinning and dry spinning. Wet spinning involves dissolving polyimide in a solvent and extruding it into a coagulation bath, forming fibers. Dry spinning dissolves the polymer in a volatile solvent, extruding it into hot air to evaporate the solvent, solidifying the fibers. Both methods cater to diverse industrial applications, including aerospace, electronics, and automotive sectors.</p></p>
