<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Steerable Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Push the Bit</li><li>Point the Bit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Rotary Steerable Systems (RSS) market can be categorized into two primary types: Push the Bit and Point the Bit. Push the Bit systems control the direction of the drill bit by applying force to the bit itself, allowing for continuous advancement while steering. In contrast, Point the Bit systems steer the drill bit by adjusting the orientation of the drill string above the bit, providing greater precision and flexibility in directing the borehole trajectory. Both methods enhance drilling efficiency and accuracy.</p></p>
